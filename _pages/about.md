I am a Research Assistant at Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University, advised by Prof. [László A. Jeni](https://www.laszlojeni.com/). I earned my Master's degree in `Artificial Intelligence` at Northwestern University. Previously, I received my Bachelor's degree in `Software Engineering` from University College Dublin (UCD) in July 2023. 

I was a research intern at Tsinghua University in 2022~2023, focusing on generative adversarial networks (GAN), advised by Prof. [Yongjin Liu](http://cg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/people/~Yongjin/Yongjin.htm). Before that, I was working on several topics related to computer vision, supervised by Dr. [Soumyabrata Dev](https://soumyabrata.dev/) at UCD.

My research interests lie in `2D/3D Computer Vision` and `Natural Language Processing`, including efficient semantic segmentation models, remote sensing, human motion capture, and VLMs.
